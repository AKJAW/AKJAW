  <h2>Hello, I'm Aleks</h2>
  <h3>I am a Blogger, Android developer and Kotlin enthusiast</h3>
</div>

üíª Courses I've been a part of:
- I'm a co-author of the [Android Next Level Course](https://www.szkolakotlina.pl/next-level) which focuses on processes outside of coding like: CI/CD, scaling your project, good git hygiene or how to cooperate with your teammates. If you're interested in an English version, checkout [my courses page](https://akjaw.com/android-next-level/).‚ÄÉ
- I've also contributed to the Kotlin Unit Testing Course for [Kotlin Testing](https://kotlintesting.com/), where I talked about testing Apollo GraphQL.

üöß I've worked on some side projects like:

- [Fuller Stack](https://github.com/AKJAW/fuller-stack-kotlin-multiplatform) - The project contains 2 client platforms (Android and a Kotlin React.js app) both of which use a Ktor server as their back-end.
- [Timi Multiplatform](https://github.com/AKJAW/Timi-Multiplatform) - Multiplatform app for Android and iOS for tracking time (Currently put on hold)
- [AiAssistant](https://github.com/AKJAW/AiAssistant) - Compose Multiplatform app for Android, iOS and Desktop. It's a pet project for my own needs, so it requires some backend endpoints, which doesn't fit everyone's use cases.
